# Prevent Data Exfiltration in Azure SQL Database Managed Instance
This repo provides documentation on how to tighten your security surface area on Azure SQL Database Managed Instances to prevent and protect against any Data exfiltration scenarios

As part of your Network Infrastructure, you might have tightened your security to make sure you have all the bells and whistles to lock down your Azure SQL Instance to be accessed only by your application and not exposed to Internet or any other traffic. However, this doesnâ€™t stop a malicious admin to take a backup or create a linked server to some other resource outside your enterprise subscription. This is called Data Exfiltration. In a typical On-prem Infrastructure, you can lock down network access completely to make sure that the data never leaves your network. However, In a cloud setup, there is a possibility that someone with elevated privileges can export data or perform any malicious activity to their own resources outside your organization which can compromise your enterprise data. Hence, it is very important to understand different data exfiltration scenarios and make sure that you are taking the right steps to both prevent and monitor such activities.

Here are different different Exfiltration scenarios.

# Backups to Unauthorized Locations
By default, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance has automatic backups that are stored on Azure storage, fully encrypted, keeping you compliant, and providing most of the functionalities that you would need. Additionally, Managed Instance also enables you to take your own COPY_ONLY backups where you get an option to take backups to a URL with the COPY_ONLY flag. This means that a malicious user can take a backup of the database to his\her personal storage account. There are couple of ways to make sure that we prevent this from happening.

## Preventive Actions
* Restricted Admin Access:
  Always follow the principle of least privilege to make sure that you are always granting the minimum permissions to your DBAs and other privileged users on your Azure SQL Managed Instance.
   [T-SQL Script to create Restricted Admin role](https://github.com/raghavender7/Prevent-Data-Exfiltration-in-Azure-SQL-Managed-Instance/blob/master/Restricted%20Admin.sql)
   
   For your Power users who need sysadmin access, here are some guidelienes
   
* Use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Managed Instance against the threat of malicious offline activity by encrypting data at rest. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application. By default, TDE is enabled for all databases. TDE is enabled by default using Service Managed Keys(where Microsoft manages the Key) and Customer Managed Keys (where you as a customer point to a key in Azure Key vault).
